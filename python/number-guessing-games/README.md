Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.

As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.

As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.

As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.

As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.

As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.

As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.

As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.

Every time a new game is started, the random number to guess should be changed so players are guessing something new.
